Your brain has its own waterscape: whether you are reading or
sleeping, fluid flows through or around the brain tissue and clears
metabolic waste in the process. These physiological processes are
crucial for the well-being of the brain. In spite of their importance
we understand them but little. Mathematical and computational
modelling could play a crucial role in gaining new insight. The aim of
these lectures is to give an introduction to the brain's waterscape in
general and mathematical and computational modelling of the brain as a
porous and elastic medium in particular.
