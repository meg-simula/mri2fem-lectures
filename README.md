# About these lectures #

This is a series of guest lectures given as part of the University of
Bergen's Porous Media Short Course Series in the Spring of 2021 . The
lectures are given online via Zoom on Jan 15, 22 and 29 at 14-16 CET.

## Lecture schedule ##

I will roughly follow the following schedule each week:

14:45-14:55: Break
14:55-15:00: Questions 
15:00-15:45: Lecture (Part 2)
15:45-15:55: Answering more questions 

Please post questions in the chat. I will address questions from the
chat after the break and at the end.

## Prior knowledge  ##

These lectures assume that you, the reader or audience, have

* Some knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) and finite
  element methods (FEM)

* No to some knowledge of brain physiology and imaging
* Knowledge of/Interest in using command-line tools

## Tips for lecturing via Zoom ##

These lectures are given via two devices: one laptop (screen) mainly
used for seeing the audience and the chat; an iPad and iPencil running
Goodnotes for showing slides with easy annotation, following links to
online material (Zenodo, Github) including videos from Youtube. 

Do a practice run of each lecture in before-hand.
